# Bluetooth Revamped for XFCE4

## Blueberry

Arch-package = blueberry

**Priority = High**

Benefits: Contains much better implementation of bluetooth connection over blueman. While blueman almost always fails at successfully pairing or connecting to a bluetooth headset/device, blueberry doesn't. It depends on gnome-bluetooth which is much mature over XFCE's default implementation
